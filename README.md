# Final-Project

# Title: Impact of Human Activities on Offshore Water Quality

# Name: Jackie(Jiaqi) Li

# Description: My goal was to prove that water temperatures and other value were higher on the nearshore route than off the route. Unfortunately, due to the selection of the data set, my results do not support my hypothesis. The values of the open sea are higher than those of the near-shore routes.
